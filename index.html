                        I utilize photography as a type of self-expression – I create images for myself, and connect with my character's secret attributes, to better understand my experience and to share my world view around me. A full understanding of myself and my environment enables me to explore snippets of life as an imaginative process, and to relate to people I would otherwise be unable to engage.

                       Inside my photos is a taste of distinctive, street, grim yet fresh themes that has influenced my surroundings. Everything I do in my existence seems to revolve around my lens. I can not possibly live where I didn't openly construct and pour my heart into my photography. I want to show people what I'm seeing through my eyes. I believe it is important to show people that "sunshine & rainbows" is not always present. It's so important to show another side of the world that you will never see, or know what it's like to be from

                        The process of my images being taken with my clients or even with my loved ones/peers is that I only give them one certain instruction to follow. That of course is being yourself. The people you see in my work are simply being themselves and act like I’m not there. They just go on with their casual day to day routines. Almost if their being spied on. But of course not making them feel uncomfortable and being awkward is also key. But most importantly is I build relationships that are professional and long lasting friendships. I don’t see them “Hey pay me and I’ll take a picture of you”, but as If Im exploring what else is there in the world and try to understand what's going on in this world we live in.
