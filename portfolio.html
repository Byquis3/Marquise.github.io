                <h2>What is new media art?</h2>

                <p>
                        What exactly is new media art? Well can definitely say modern tech is part of it? Well by modern technology, generally a huge role for media art, provides for a range of new forms of contemporary art. We tend to equate art as a culture with film, television, and popular music of today. Although these are quite well known, in the last few decades new areas of expression in art have expanded considerably. Many of the New Media Art fields entail kinetic sculpture, which is an art form that involves making robots. Other new media arts into today’s age consist of information art, organic and algorithmic art, digital art, game design, machinima amd many more!
Traditionally we tend to believe of art (art in the old days as well)  as composed to drawing, watercolor, printing, statue and film photograph. Well into the modern world artist might also include film production production. Computer graphics developments had already ushered digital format based craft into mainstream movie seeking to make to the general public. And this is where I fit into this category. 
I extremely love capturing the moment whether it’s in a video format or through a photograph. I always think of it a as time travel, since you are capturing a piece of time and looking back it is like. But it’s just called memories in simple terms. 
I’m not just your simple creator where you think I just take weeding portraits, sports photography, tutoria and prom photos (even though I still do these kinds of gigs for that extra money in my pocket). I am heavily influence by today's hip-hop culture. Without it I woundn’t be where I am today. It made me of I am. I direct and edit music videos. Primarily for bay area artist for now. 
When I first started out finding a style for was hard. I knew I loved editing and shooting music videos but my my videos would always come “Boring”. My videos would always just clip after clip with no touch ups. So for me I always looked up “David Camerena”. He is a bay area based videographer, director, and cinematographer, one of the other reasons why I connect to this artist is because he’s from the bay! I support my locals. His shots were always the cleanest to me when I was growing up. Not only he was the first director I looked up to, but he has made videos for my favorite artists. Such as; “HBK GANG”, “Kehlani”, and “Mozzy”. He paved a wave for me mentally. It actually gave me the courage that I can pursue my dreams.
